                        <h2>Primary and Secondary School: "St. Anthony's Convent High School"</h2>
                        <p>
                                St. Anthony School was the best school in entire town of Vasai, India. it had the
                                biggest playground with the best teachers who are always there to help their students.
                                Also this school had many top rankers from Mumbai University. It is one of the top
                                ranked Maharashtra Board Schools on basis of performance in SSC examinations.
                        </p>
                        <p>When in 5th grade, it was the first time when we had "Computer" as our course in our
                                syllabus, and we had to learn about MS Word,
                                MS Excel, MS PowerPoint. "Computer" course was my favourite in entire period of my
                                secondary schooling. It was the only course where we were told to do anything and test
                                things on computer softwares.

                                My favorite memory in this school was when, the soccer team was formed for the first
                                time in our school I was the second person to get chosen for the team.
                                Also when we won the interschool tournament I was been awarded as the best Defender in
                                the entire tournament and receiving an award from my school principal was of great
                                honor to me.

                        <p>
                                Thakur Junior College was started in 1992 to serve the needs of students passing SSC
                                examination from the schools around Kandivali area and Thakur Vidya Mandir which has
                                already established itself as one of the schools in the area. It offers courses at
                                primarily the higher secondary and under-graduate levels. The courses at the
                                undergraduate
                                and post-graduate level are offered in affiliation with Mumbai University, Mumbai.

                                My favorite course/class was "Software". I was always fascinated with programing and
                                how computer software work. It was then the first time where I did write my first
                                "Hello World"
                                Program in C language. I was really amazed about how exactly this works. It was the
                                only course where I researched a lot and due to this increased interest I failed to
                                concentrate on another subjects. So just got
                                passing grade in another courses.

                                It's hard to pick favourite memory, but a fond memory I have is having a barbecue with
                                my friends from my dorm senior year. It just stands out in my mind because it was one
                                of the few occasions where we were all together,
                                joking around and having fun. Also, there was food.

                        <p>
                                My favourite course in my undergrad was "Data Structures". It was the first time were I
                                understood how complex and beautiful the computer programs are
                                and how are they used in real world execution. We had the best professor teaching this
                                course who always make us to laugh. Due to him I came to know how amazing
                                Computer Science field is.

                                My favorite memory in thus college was when, my teacher came to our class with our answer sheets. 
                                It was "Artificial Intelligence" subject. He gave us the answer sheets and I was waiting for my turn 
                                to get the answer sheet. He said my name, my heart was beating with 160 beats per minute and was super nervous. 
                                I got my sheet and looked for the marks.
                                It was shocking that I got 28/30 marks. I was surprised, happy and with mixed feelings. As the way I do, I looked 
                                at the sheets and was satisfied with the marks that was given. I summed up all the marks and it was 27. Well! I thought 
                                to be quiet and give back the sheet. But, as he was my favorite teacher so how could I cheat him?
                                I went to him and informed about the incorrect summation that he did of my marks. My other friends before me were discussing their problems. 
                                When it was my turn, he looked at me with strange expressions.
                                My teacher asked if someone was having a red pen to change my marks. He was asking for the pen as if he was going to cut my marks. 
                                But, later to my shock, he looked at my sheet and looked for the marks where he gave 4/5 marks and changed it to 4.5 marks 
                                (So total would be 27.5 which when we round off it becomes 28). He looked at me with a short smile and said, "Well now it 28 
                                so go to your seat and sit down". As I was surprised, I asked him why did he do it. He said, "You should get marks for honesty as well". 
                                It was the first time that this happened to me.
                                It is truly said, "Honesty is the best policy".
